## The Green Shift: Energy Transition and Climate Policy in Europe 🌍⚡

### 🔁 Reproducibility & Project Overview

> **An interactive data-driven storytelling project analyzing the shift from fossil fuels to renewable sources, highlighting how EU policies have reshaped national energy profiles.**

This project explores the energy transition using **interactive web-based storytelling**.
✅ The codebase is open, and the data transformation steps are managed via a Python script to ensure transparency.

**🌐 Live Website:** [https://justwsx.github.io/DataVisualizationProject/](https://justwsx.github.io/DataVisualizationProject/)

### 1. 🧹 Data Preprocessing Pipeline

🗂️ The data processing logic is contained in the `process.py` script located in the root directory. Run this script to regenerate the cleaned datasets used by the visualization.

### Step 1: 🧼 Data Cleaning & Enrichment
- **Script:** `process.py`
- **Input:** Raw data located in the `data/` folder (including Fossil Fuel Prices).
- **Operations:**
  - Imports raw CSV data (World Energy Consumption / Our World in Data).
  - Filters specifically for **EU Member States**.
  - Handles missing values via linear interpolation.
  - Normalizes metrics (per capita / percentages) for fair comparison.
- **Output:** Processed JSON/CSV files saved into `data/`, optimized for D3.js.

#### ▶️ To run preprocessing
If you need to update the data or reproduce the cleaning steps:

1. 📦 Install dependencies (see Section 4).
2. 🧪 Run the script from the root folder:

```bash
python process.py
```

### 2. 🚀 Serving the Website Locally

🧱 The website uses **D3.js** to fetch data asynchronously. To avoid CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) security blocks, you cannot simply open the `.html` files directly. You must use a local server.

### Option: 🐍 Python HTTP Server (Fastest)
From the project root directory, run:

```bash
python -m http.server 8000
```

Then open http://localhost:8000 in your browser 🌍.

### 📌 Where does the data for visualizations live?
✅ **All data used by the website's visualizations is in the `data/` folder.**
The HTML pages (e.g., `economics.html`, `mix.html`) load specific subsets of data processed by `process.py` and render them using the scripts found in `js/` and `main.js`.
